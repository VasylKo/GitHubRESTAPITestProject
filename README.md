# GitHubRESTAPITestProject

This is my Swift app that uses a GitHub web service to get data from the GitHub gists API.
The app is made during reading the book by Christina Moulton - "iOS Apps with REST APIs: Building Web-Driven Apps in Swift".

**In this app you can:**  
1. Look at a list of public gists to see whatâ€™s new.  
3. Star a gist so you can find it later.  
4. Look at a list of gists you have starred.  
5. Look at a list of your own gists.  
6. Look at details for a gist in a list.  
7. Create a new gist.  
8. Delete one of your gists.  

**Tech stack:** Swift 2.3, iOS 9, and Xcode 7.3.1  
**Main Pods:** SwiftyJSON v2.3, Alamofire v3.1

**Tags:** REST, Alamofire, parsing JSON, OAuth, App Transport Security, setting headers.
